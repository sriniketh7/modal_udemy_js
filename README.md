The JavaScript program that I've developed is an interactive user interface featuring three distinct modal windows. The primary functionality revolves around the ability to open these modal windows upon clicking a designated button, and then offering multiple options for their closure.

Upon clicking the designated "Open Modal" button, users are presented with a modal window that overlays the main content. The modal window contains some information

The real innovation of this program comes with the diverse options provided for closing the modal windows. Users can either:

Click the Cross Mark: Each modal window features a prominent cross mark in the upper-right corner. A simple click on this mark effectively closes the modal window, allowing users to return to the main content.

Press the Escape Key: To provide an intuitive user experience, the modal window can also be closed by pressing the "Escape" key on the keyboard. This is a familiar action for users who frequently interact with modal interfaces, enhancing overall usability.

Click Anywhere in the Layout Interface: The program takes usability a step further by allowing users to close the modal window by clicking anywhere outside the modal itself. This approach ensures a seamless interaction flow and reduces friction in the user experience.
